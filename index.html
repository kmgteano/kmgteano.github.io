<p>I'm Katrina-Mae G. Teaño [teh-AH-nyo | tɛ.a'ɲo ]. Most people call me Katrina. </p>

<p>For as long as I can remember, mathematics has been my passion. Through <a href="http://www.prepforprep.org">Prep for Prep</a>, a program for gifted students of color in the greater New York City area, I was graced with the unique privilege of attending <a href="http://www.brearley.org">The Brearley School</a>, a fantastic private school for ambitious and inquisitive young women. While there, I took courses in calculus and statistics and learned to fold paper cranes, all of which influenced me deeply; I did a brief senior thesis on the presentation of crease patterns as diagrams to demonstrate origami structures.</p>

<p>I then attended <a href="http://www.fit.edu">Florida Institute of Technology</a>, one of the finest universities in the Southeast, and my love for mathematics only grew. I earned a Bachelor's of Science in Applied Mathematics <em>cum laude</em> from the university. I was the first student to receive the Lakshmikantham Mathematics Scholarship for excellence in mathematics, and was part of the inaugural Undergraduate Biomathematics Research Team, which did cutting-edge research using mathematical techniques to make sense of biology's most complex questions.</p>

<p>I decided to stay at Florida Tech for graduate school, quckly picking up a Master's of Science in Operations Resarch, which tightened my focus on statistics, optimization, modeling, and discrete mathematics. My final program exam covered all of these topics; I also wrote a paper during my graph theory couse on crease patterns as planar graphs and the proof that the flat folding problem is NP-complete, which I like to think brought things full circle.</p>

<p>Nowadays I am working as an educator, though my goal is to apply my background towards the rapidly growing and incredibly fascinating field of data science and machine learning. </p>

<p>I'm more than just a pile of math knowledge, and I fully believe in embracing all parts of my interests in my life!</p>

<p>Here's a list of some of the things I enjoy!</p>

<ul>
<li>eggless cooking and baking, and generally gathering food resources for fellow food allergy sufferers</li>
<li>the independent game community, particularly roguelikes, experimental games/game jam results, and charity marathoning</li>
<li>visual expression through nail art and makeup</li>
</ul>
