Most people call me Katrina. \r\n\r\n### Mathematician\r\nFor as long as I can remember, mathematics has been my passion. Through [Prep for Prep](http://www.prepforprep.org), a program for gifted students of color in the greater New York City area, I was graced with the unique privilege of attending [The Brearley School](http://www.brearley.org), a fantastic private school for ambitious and inquisitive young women. While there, I took courses in calculus and statistics and learned to fold paper cranes, all of which influenced me deeply; I did a brief senior thesis on the presentation of crease patterns as diagrams to demonstrate origami structures.\r\n\r\nI then attended [Florida Institute of Technology](http://www.fit.edu), one of the finest universities in the Southeast, and my love for mathematics only grew. I earned a Bachelor's of Science in Applied Mathematics *cum laude* from the university. I was the first student to receive the Lakshmikantham Mathematics Scholarship for excellence in mathematics, and was part of the inaugural Undergraduate Biomathematics Research Team, which did cutting-edge research using mathematical techniques to make sense of biology's most complex questions.\r\n\r\nI decided to stay at Florida Tech for graduate school, quckly picking up a Master's of Science in Operations Resarch, which tightened my focus on statistics, optimization, modeling, and discrete mathematics. My final program exam covered all of these topics; I also wrote a paper during my graph theory couse on crease patterns as planar graphs and the proof that the flat folding problem is NP-complete, which I like to think brought things full circle.\r\n\r\nNowadays I am working as an educator, though my goal is to apply my background towards the rapidly growing and incredibly fascinating field of data science and machine learning. \r\n\r\n### Beyond Math\r\nI'm more than just a pile of math knowledge, and I fully believe in embracing all parts of my interests in my life!\r\n\r\nHere's a list of some of the things I enjoy!\r\n\r\n* eggless cooking and baking, and generally gathering food resources for fellow food allergy sufferers\r\n* the independent game community, particularly roguelikes, experimental games/game jam results, and charity marathoning\r\n* visual expression through nail art and makeup\r\n\r\n### More to come!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
